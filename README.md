# PR Checklist
---
## Introduction
The purpose of this repo is to create a base standard template to help with doing code reviews for pull requests.

## Checklist
The Checklist.md file outlines the template to include when making a Pull Request and sending it to review. The idea here is to help speed up some of the review overhead by giving the reviewers a standardised list of things to check for when making the review. Hopefully this should speed the process up while making it more thorough and prevent items not being checked.
